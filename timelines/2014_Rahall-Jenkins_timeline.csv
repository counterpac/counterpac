    <span class=""source"">Charleston Gazette</span>
    <p class=""desc"">Having made his fortune as creator of the online gaming company Kongregate, Jim Greer is trying to take a stand against the inundation of “dark money” political attack ads that he believes are taking over elections across the U.S. Greer founded CounterPAC, a new group he thinks has a simple plan for countering the millions of dollars these groups are spending to affect the outcome of Congressional elections across the country.</p>

    <span class=""source"">Charleston Gazette</span>
    <p class=""desc"">It didn’t take long for Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., to reject an invitation from his Republican opponent, state Sen. Evan Jenkins, to ban outside spending in their race for Congress. Friday morning, Jenkins proposed a ban on all spending by outside groups and on campaign donations from political action committees — after such groups already have played a significant role in the campaign for both candidates. About two and a half hours later, Rahall’s campaign emphatically declined to participate, saying it was too late.

    <span class=""source"">Charleston Gazette</span>
    <p class=""desc"">Although it appears nothing will come of it in the state’s 3rd Congressional District race, an effort by Silicon Valley Internet gaming entrepreneur Jim Greer to stem the inundation of “dark money” political attack ads by outside interest groups (often with secret donors) deserves kudos.

    <span class=""source"">Charleston Daily Mail</span>
    <p class=""desc"">Why not take the pledge to eliminate dark money in the race? It could be a nice test of this new idea in West Virginia, bring about a cleaner, more positive campaign that deals with issues important to West Virginians, and not necessarily outsiders. Voters who are concerned about outside money will take note, especially if one candidate is willing to accept the pledge and the other not.

    <strong class=""title"">Nick Rahall: Time to pull back curtain on dark money</strong>
    <p class=""desc"">
      The Center for Public Integrity has released findings that, while not surprising, were shocking nonetheless. They found that a secretive network of non-profit organizations affiliated with a pair of billionaire brothers will be responsible for airing one in 10 political ads in 2014 U.S. Senate races. Here in West Virginia’s 3rd Congressional district, those same shadow groups are on track to spend over $3 million trying to elect my opponent, Evan Jenkins.

    <span class=""source"">Politico</span>
    <p class=""desc"">CounterPAC is out with an ad hitting West Virginia Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall for his refusal to turn down outside money on his behalf. The ad, supported by a six-figure buy, is slated to run on West Virgini broadcast, according to a spokesman for the group. Rahall drew the ire of the ire of the PAC after he stood up his opponent at a planned meeting to discuss curbing the influence of outside money in the contest.

      Because Rahall refused to ultimately finalize an agreement, there will be no relief for voters from the onslaught of ads. Outside groups receiving money from untraceable sources have already spent more than $2 million on the Rahall/Jenkins race alone.
