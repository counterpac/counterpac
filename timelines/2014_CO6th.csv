    <strong class=""title"">A new PAC's challenge to Coffman, Romanoff - Reject spending of ""secret money""</strong>
    <span class=""source"">The Denver Post</span>
    <p class=""desc"">A challenge to U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman and Democratic opponent Andrew Romanoff to reject all “secret money” in their race - essentially, some of the millions spent by outside groups to influence the election - isn’t gaining much traction. Coffman has brushed off the suggestion, while Romanoff says he’s in - but only if Coffman agrees.

    <span class=""source"">The Denver Post</span>
    <p class=""desc"">A political-action committee is hitting U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman with a new hard-edged TV ad after Coffman declined its challenge to disavow some types of outside spending in his race for re-election. We reported previously that CounterPAC is a political-action committee set up by wealthy tech donors to pressure candidates in some competitive races - including Colorado’s 6th Congressional District - into discouraging outside “dark money” spending from groups that are able to shield their donors.

    <span class=""source"">Politico Morning Score</span>
    <p class=""desc"">CounterPAC, a recently formed group opposing so-called “dark money,” is going up this week with an ad lambasting GOP Rep. Mike Coffman in Colorado’s 6th District for not signing the group’s pledge. The ad speculates about the identities of donors to pro-Coffman groups. It’s backed by six figures on Denver broadcast for a week, said the group.

    <p class=""desc"">U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman’s campaign has sent cease-and-desist letters to four Denver TV stations airing an ad that makes wild claims about the potential financial backers of outside groups supporting Coffman.
