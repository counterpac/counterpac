        <h1>To fix our broken democracy,<br> we need to change the underlying incentives.</h1>
        <div class="section_copy slant_translucent invert clear">
          <div class="leftcol column">
            <p>An overwhelming majority of Americans agree that money in politics is a problem. But how do we fix it? At CounterPAC, we believe 
              the answer lies in changing incentive structures.</p>
            <p>Like any other rational actors, politicians make decisions based on what's in their self-interest - in this case, whatever helps 
              them get elected to office. Because politicians rely on campaign money to reach and persuade voters, all other things being equal, 
              they aren't going to drive the change we need of their own accord.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="rightcol column">
            <p>Theoretically, voters could incentivize politicians to take action on this issue by holding them accountable at the ballot box. 
              Problematically, however, 91% of Americans currently believe it's impossible to achieve the reform we need. Without a public 
              expectation of reform, there can be no public accountability for politicians who fail to take action - and thus no incentive 
              for them to do so.</p>
            <p>The result is a vicious cycle: money's corruption of our elections begets public cynicism; accountability mechanisms fail 
              because the public is cynical rather than engaged; and without anything to keep corruption in check, it grows worse.</p>

        <div class="section_copy slant_translucent invert">
          <p>If we want to change the role that money plays in American elections, we need to break this cycle. In practice, this means 
            mounting successful interventions that visibly improve electoral accountability. If our problem is that widespread corruption 
            causes cynicism and erodes accountability mechanisms, then we need to create models of reform solutions at work to restore 
            public hope and inspire engagement.</p>
          <p>For this reason, it is critical that we focus on campaigns that</p>
          <ol>
            <li>we can win; and </li>
            <li>precipitate clear, positive outcomes<br>in the near term.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We must then leverage these opportunities to amplify the message that reform is both possible and worth fighting for.</p>

        <div class="section_copy">
          <p><strong>We see great potential</strong> for well-structured pledge agreements between candidates in high-profile races to serve as 
            the kind of attainable, yet effective, models of reform that we need to advance a solutions-oriented conversation and combat 
            public cynicism.</p>
          <p>The goal of CounterPAC's advocacy is to create conditions that lead to the execution of pledge agreements within the context of high-profile races, making the races more accountable to the public in clearly visible ways.</p>
          <strong class="callout">Simple, common sense agreements<br>can serve as powerful models of reform.</strong>
          <p class="leftcol column">During the 2012 Massachusetts Senate race, Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown signed a mutual pledge in which they agreed to reject unlimited spending by super PACs and other outside groups. They promised that if either of them received support from an outside group, the candidate benefiting from the expenditure would take a proportional amount of money out of their own campaign account and let their opponent donate it to charity.</p>
          <div class="rightcol column">
            <p>With the stroke of a pen, this pledge agreement successfully disincentivized spending activity by outside groups and measurably improved the accountability of the race. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Outside spending was reduced by 93%;</li>
              <li>No TV attack ads were run by outside groups;</li>
              <li>Negative advertising overall was cut in half;</li>
              <li>Small-dollar donations exceeded outside spending 3:1.</li>

            <dt class="question">Who are you?</dt>
            <dd class="answer">We are a group of concerned citizens who believe that unlimited dark money is corrupting our political system. We have backgrounds varying from tech entrepreneurs to political advisors. See <a href="{{ site.url }}/people/team/">the People page</a> for a complete list.
            </dd>
            <dt class="question">Why would any politician take the CounterPAC pledge?</dt>
            <dd class="answer">First and foremost, because most of them understand that getting secret money out of elections is good for America. But also, politicians want to run their own campaigns. Like anyone, they would prefer to tell their own story rather than have it told for them. But, like an arms race, they are unlikely to eliminate dark money unilaterally; they are much more willing to disarm if the other side disarms as well. Hence the bilateral nature of the pledge.
            </dd>
            <dt class="question">Why focus on untraceable &#8220;dark&#8221; money?</dt>
            <dd class="answer">We need to start with something almost everyone supports. From Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the left to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas on the right, leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for an end to secret campaign spending. By starting with a common-sense agreement, we can make a real impact in races this year without waiting for action by Congress or anyone else.
            </dd>
            <dt class="question">What makes you think this will work?</dt>
            <dd class="answer">
                Because it already has. The Massachusetts Senate race in 2012 used a version of the pledge called &#8220;The People's Pledge&#8221; that went even further than just requiring disclosure of donors and it worked.
