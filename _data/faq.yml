- question: Who are you?
  answer: We are a group of concerned citizens who believe that unlimited dark money is corrupting our political system. We have backgrounds varying from tech entrepreneurs to political advisors. See <a href="/people/team/">the People page</a> for a complete list.

- question: Why would any politician take the CounterPAC pledge?
  answer: First and foremost, because most of them understand that getting unlimited outside spending and secret money out of elections is good for America. But also, politicians want to run their own campaigns. Like anyone, they would prefer to tell their own story rather than have it told for them. But, like an arms race, they are unlikely to eliminate dark money unilaterally; they are much more willing to disarm if the other side disarms as well. Hence the bilateral nature of the pledge.

- question: What makes you think this will work?
  answer: Because it already has. The Massachusetts Senate race in 2012 used a version of the pledge called &#8220;The People's Pledge&#8221; that went even further than just requiring disclosure of donors and it worked.

- question: Where will you be active during 2016?
  answer: You can follow CounterPAC's activity, including any ads that we run, on <a href="/pledges/no-dark-money/">Our Work</a> page.

- question: What did you accomplish in 2014?
  answer: In three of the most competitive races in the congressional midterm (AK-Sen, WV-03, CO-06), we brought the issue of "dark," untraceable money to the forefront of the debate, advancing a solutions-oriented conversation and forcing candidates to respond.

- question: Why the focus on untraceable &#8220;dark&#8221; money in 2014?
  answer: We needed to start with something almost everyone supports. From Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the left to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas on the right, leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for an end to secret campaign spending. By starting with a common-sense agreement we made a real impact in races in 2014 without waiting for action by Congress or anyone else.

- question: Who are your funders?
  answer: CounterPAC is generously funded by individual citizens committed to restoring integrity to our elections. See <a href="/people/donors/">the Donors page</a> for a full list.
