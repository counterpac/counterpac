    <p class=""desc"">Yet another group from outside Alaska is getting involved in the state’s hotly contested U.S. Senate race, but this time it’s a political action committee seeking to get rid of some outside ad spending. Its target: the money from large groups that do not disclose their donors.</p>

    <strong class=""title"">A simple handshake could restore accountability to Alaska's Senate race</strong>
    <span class=""source"">Alaska Dispatch News</span>
    <p class=""desc"">In recent years, a tremendous surge in campaign spending from untraceable donors, front groups and shell corporations has eroded our democracy and created an election season that feels more like an auction season. Fortunately for Alaska voters, Senate candidates Mark Begich, Democrat, and Dan Sullivan, Republican, can end the flood of secret money in their race and create an example for the nation with a simple, common-sense agreement.
