    <strong class="ptm">The goal of CounterPAC&#8217;s advocacy</strong>
    <p>is to incentivize candidates to take reform pledges that bring greater accountability to their own campaign practices, generating models of reform that demonstrate its possibility and underscore its value.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Supreme Court decisions such as <i>Citizens United</i> and <i>SpeechNow</i>, it is now totally legal for corporations, super PACs, and other "outside" groups to spend unlimited amounts of money to swing the outcome of an election. Although these groups are supposed to operate independent of any candidate campaign, it is common practice for them to use underhanded tactics such as hiring candidates' former campaign staff in order to skirt this rule, and thereby the contribution limits to which they would otherwise be subject.</p>
    <p>Already this cycle, super PACs have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, suggesting that the flood of outside money in this year's election will be worse than ever. In a post-<i>Citizens United</i> world where legislating our way out of the super PAC problem isn't possible, a "no outside money" pledge has the unique potential to stem the flow of outside money.</p>
