It's been a big week at CounterPAC. Last Thursday, we launched our first wave of ads in Alaska, Georgia, and West Virginia calling on candidates to take our "no dark money" pledge.

Already, people are paying attention. Our launch received coverage from national outlets such as [CNN](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/07/30/first-on-cnn-new-pac-launches-ads-to-limit-flood-of-outside-spending/), the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/07/31/yet-another-super-pac-is-using-big-money-to-take-on-big-money), and [HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/01/campaign-finance-reform_n_5642339.html?utm_hp_ref=politics) and major local outlets in all three of our target states.

But even more exciting, we received an immediate response from one of the candidates. The day after we launched our ad campaign, Evan Jenkins, the Republican candidate for West Virginia's 3rd congressional district, responded to our pledge by thanking us for the opportunity to debate this issue with his opponent, Nick Rahall, and proposing a money-in-politics pledge of his own that would reject not only dark money, but all outside money and even PAC contributions.

Though Rahall hasn't agreed to sign a pledge yet, we have every intention of keeping the pressure on in the West Virginia race — and likewise in Alaska and Georgia.

The fact that we were able to make campaign spending an issue so quickly in one of this year's most competitive races gives us great hope for what we can accomplish going forward.

So stay tuned — there will be more to come very soon. In the meantime, be sure to follow us on Facebook and Twitter to keep up with the latest.
