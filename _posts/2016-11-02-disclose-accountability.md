CounterPAC, a nonpartisan organization working for more accountable elections by incentivizing the adoption of model reforms, has distributed a mailer campaign related to the voting records of candidates in two key state legislative races on AB 700, the California DISCLOSE Act.

In Senate District 29, CounterPAC's mailer praises Republican Ling Ling Chang for her support of the DISCLOSE Act. In Assembly District 65, CounterPAC's mailer criticizes Republican incumbent Young Kim for having voted against the bill. Both races are highly competitive, with polls showing a dead heat in the week before the election.

“The DISCLOSE Act is a common-sense bill that would give California voters real-time access to critical information about who's funding the political ads that seek to influence their decisions at the ballot box,” said Jay Costa, Executive Director of CounterPAC. "It's plain and simple: a vote for the DISCLOSE Act is a vote for the public interest; a vote against the bill is a vote to protect special interests. From the outset, CounterPAC made clear its commitment to holding candidates accountable based on what position they took, and we're following through on that promise."

After passing the Assembly in January 2016, the DISCLOSE Act fell one vote short of the 2/3 majority it needed to pass the Senate in August, failing to garner any votes from Republican senators.<br>

<strong>Background on the Disclose Act</strong>

AB 700, sponsored by Assemblymembers Jimmy Gomez and Marc Levine, would have required the actual names of the top three funders behind ballot measure ads and ads paid for by outside groups to be clearly displayed on the advertisement.

For television and video advertising, the bill would require the original source of funding to a ballot measure committee or political action committee for or against a candidate to be clearly displayed for a full five seconds on the bottom one-third of the screen.
