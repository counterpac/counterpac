    <strong class="title">Tech PAC needles Rahall</strong>
    <span class="source">Politico</span>
    <p class="desc">CounterPAC is out with an ad hitting West Virginia Democratic 
      Rep. Nick Rahall for his refusal to turn down outside money on his behalf. 
      The ad, supported by a six-figure buy, is slated to run on West Virginia 
      broadcast, according to a spokesman for the group. Rahall drew the ire of 
      the PAC after he stood up his opponent at a planned meeting to discuss curbing 
      the influence of outside money in the contest.

    <span class="source">Charleston Gazette</span>
    <p class="desc">The Center for Public Integrity has released findings that, while not surprising, were shocking nonetheless. They found that a secretive network of non-profit organizations affiliated with a pair of billionaire brothers will be responsible for airing one in 10 political ads in 2014 U.S. Senate races. Here in West Virginia’s 3rd Congressional district, those same shadow groups are on track to spend over $3 million trying to elect my opponent, Evan Jenkins.
